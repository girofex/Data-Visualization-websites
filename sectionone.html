            <h2 id="where">Protests and Battles: Where They Happen, and Why You Should Care</h2>

            <h3 id="where1">Mapping Misery across the Globe</h3>
            <p>While conflicts and events happen all over the world, the way in which they play out varies between
                countries.
                Through the next plots, we intend to highlight these differences.

        <div class="column">
            <h4 id="where2">The Steppes are not as Quiet as They May Look</h4>

            <p>The following plot shows the number of events recorded for each of the world regions.
                The first thing that is noticed is the higher number of events in Europe and Central Asia, even compared
                to
                regions historically troubled, like the Middle East and Africa. Comparatively, North America
                <i>seems</i> to live a peaceful time.

        <div id="barchart"></div>

        <div class="column">
            <h4 id="where3">Different Country, Different Conflict</h4>

            <p>Numbers alone mean nothing: the following chart helps us discern how different regions of the world are
                plagued by different types of clashes.
                North America is characterized exclusively by protests and riots. A similar prominence is present in the
                asian regions.
                The countries more beaten by military conflicts seem to be the ones in Europe and the Middle East.
                Lastly, we can see how violence against civilians
                dominates the leaderboard in Africa and Latin America.
            </p>

        <div class="column">
            <h4 id="where4">It Takes a Village to Wage a War</h4>

            <p>Another important metric to consider is how much of the population is affected by such events. Even
                though regions may register lots of events,
                that does not mean much if few people are involved. In fact, looking at the following plot, we can see
                how it is dominated by
                Latin America, where battles seem to affect great part of the population, together with violence on
                civilians. Other points of interest
                include the higher quantity of remote violence events in Europe, and of protests and riots in Asia.

            <h3 id="why">Why you should care</h3>

            <p>After taking a look at our visualizations, it is possible that You, the reader, may wonder when you come
                into the picture.
                You may think that such events affects only soldiers and terrorists, people who go out of their way to
                get into trouble. But this couldn't be farther from the truth.
            </p>

            <h4 id="why1">Is War a Civilian's Job?</h4>

            <p>The following plot compares the clashes between military factions with violent events on the civilian
                population. We can see how, with the exception of Europe,
                civilians are often involved in violent events, sometimes even more than the military in the case of
                Latin America. Even in the smaller data pool of North America
                we see a greater number of events involving civilians.

        <div id="groupedbarchart"></div>

        <div class="column">
            <h4 id="why2">When Protest Speaks and When It Shouts</h4>

            <p>Lastly, we take a look at protests, and how often they turn into violent demonstrations. The related plot
                seems quite comforting in this scenario,
                with the highest value being around 20%. Still, it means that almost one protest out of five turns into
                a violent clash.
